## GotoGrocery Documentation

On this webpage, you will find all the documentation about the GotoGrocery API and Documentation.

### Introduction
This program is written in C#. The team has collaborated on the project in Visual Studio (VS) Community and all VS Solutions are included within the repository for convenience.

### Prerequisites
In order for this application to work, it must be able to contact a MySQL server with all the database information being stored there. For testing purposes, MySQL Workbench was run and simulated in order to design this application. 

### Usage
This section will detail how to use the application.

### Member Class
#### Methods
The methods for this class are as follows:
- Method 1: Something
  - This is to do with this...
- Method 1: Something
  - This is to do with this...
##### Validation
The validation method returns a binary value with each bit representing whether validation has passed or failed for a specific property of the class. The relation of bit to property is as follows:
- Bit 0: NA
- Bit 1: First Name
- Bit 2: Last Name
- Bit 3: Phone Number
- Bit 4: Membership Status
- Bit 5: Membership Start Date
- Bit 6: NA
- Bit 7: NA
If any of the bits are not returned as a "1" or set high, then it is the programmer's job to rectify the issue. 

#### Properties
All properties within the Member Class are able to get and set. No validation occurs when setting and the validation method must be called to check for the respective validity of set variable.
