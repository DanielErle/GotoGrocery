# About Repo
This project is for a unit (SWE20001 Managing Software Projects) at university ( Swinburne University of Technology) that is for a made up client known as GoTo Grocery. In simple terms, the aim is to create a digital system for the client ( a membership based grocery store ) that will allow the client to pursue their daily business on a digital platform with a simple and easy to use graphical user interface that enables them to update member details and inventory levels. The application should also be able to export the inventory levels to a ".csv" file so that the client can manually order stock when inventory levels are running low. For a more detailed document outlining the requirements, please see below.
